Normally, I really don't like to publish data on the Internet. This has a series of reasons like:
* content on the net is written in ink, it will remain there for a long time and what I'm proud of today may embarasse me tomorrow.
* there are tons of magnificient pages, forums, wikis, videos, tutorials and blogs with almost every trick, life-hack, tip and hint someone can imagine, so no need at all to clog the net with further &quot;wannaBe-cool-stuff&quot;.

#### So why the sudden change in mind?

As part of my [further training](https://www.teko.ch), I'm obliged to report and present some result of an exercise in form of a blog. So, therefore, it seems to me that I should open my mind an join the community off __bloggers__ ;-)
